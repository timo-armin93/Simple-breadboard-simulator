The breadboard simulator program has resistor place and remove function. User can place and remove resistors horizontally but not vertically. When input the resistors you have a starting point of x and y coordinates and ending point of x and y coordinates. 

When removing the resistors, input the start point of the x and y resistors to fully remove the resistor from the board.
The resistor can not overlap each other. I.e (2 1, 2 4) and (2 1, 2 6) will give an error message.

The resistors prints with yellow color for fully highlighting the place of the resistors.
The size of the board is declared in build time. 

-------Main function is located in board.c-----
